schema-scheme
=============
An extensible hosted dsl for creating json schemas.

This project has been abandoned. I did it as an exercise to learn how to use ee-lib and bindingspec for language-oriented programming. I don't think this library will be very useful since it's just like `match`, but more confusing and patterns have "return values" in a sense.

The most current expander/compiler lives in `private/bindingspec-expander.rkt`.
